Are you a teacher looking for a new grading system?
Are you a principal or administrator looking to use aging hardware again?
Do your computers still run MS-DOS?

If you answered "yes" to any of the above questions, then consider:
The NCBGSD!

WHY NCBGSD:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlike other bulky and expensive grade databasing systems, the NCBGSD
is extremely simple, with a mere 5KB executable file that can handle
as many students as needed!

Written in the Practical Extraction and Reporting Language (or PERL for short),
the NCBGSD is a no-nonsense way to quickly grade and generate reports for
hundreds to thousands of students at a time! Moreover, the patent-pending
Honor Student Binary Grading System incentivizes students to do their best like
no other grading system!

THE GRADING SYSTEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlike other grading systems that use a sliding scale, the Honor Student Binary
Grading System (or HSBG) uses a simple 1 and 0 system. A 1 is a pass, and a 0 is
a failure. Moreover, the HSBG operates with the logical XOR as the primary
algorithm for determining GPAs, making marking a snap!

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installation is as easy as 1, 2, 3!
Simply download the GitHub repository, run the install.bat script, and crack
open a drink as the NCBGSD installs itself!

So why wait? Download now, and use the NCBGSD today!
As a special offer, submit comments and emails relating to your usage of the
NCBGSD to N-C Softworks and you could be featured on our Instagram page! We will
also be sending field technicians out to the first 15 schools to adopt this
system to configure it for free!
